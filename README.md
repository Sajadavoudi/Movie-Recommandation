# Content-Based Movie Recommendation System

This project implements a simple content-based movie recommender using text metadata such as titles, genres, and overviews to suggest similar movies.

The system is built in Python with pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn, and uses TF-IDF vectorization with cosine similarity to compute movie-to-movie relationships.

An interactive interface powered by ipywidgets allows users to select a movie and instantly view recommendations inside a Jupyter Notebook.
